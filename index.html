    they told me to forget<br />
    they said it was foolish<br />
    but love like this doesn’t ask for permission<br />
    it roots itself in the bones<br />
    in the silence<br />
    in the nights i carved your name into my prayers<br />
    this isn’t just a message<br />
    it’s a memory that refused to die.<br />
    you are not a chapter<br />
    you are the story.<br />
